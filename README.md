## Notes:
- this project is based on the ElectronJS , Electron-builder and Chromium . these are choosen because of simplicity and cross-platform capabilities of them
- the idea of this project was to provide a simple way to create gui applications with any language and have the power to use web tech because of their strong community and tons of frameworks availability
- for now the project does not have so much security features for keeping your html , css and js code safe because of its open source nature so if you want to use it and keep your source code safe , add authentication to the project so other people dont be able to replace the project with malicious one and and steal your ui code also compile your html , css and js file
- this project is not aiming to have strict rules for config files , they can have any names based on your use cases
- if there is any features that project is lacking of , i would be glad to you help me in making this project a perfect one but we all know nothing will be perfect
