# Native EMWebKit : A Retrospective

Project Status: Development Halted


## Project Objective
- The Native EMWebKit project aimed to provide a seamless interface for developers to create GUI applications that leverage native webviews on various systems. By integrating with the system’s webview, developers could effortlessly incorporate web content into their applications.

## Key Focus Areas
- Native EMWebKit acted as a bridge between applications and the native webview. with one difference than EMWebKit and its being more lightweight because it would depend on the OS

## Challenges Encountered
### Quality of Microsoft Edge WebView2:
- Initially, the project relied on the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime in Windows.
- Unfortunately, issues related to stability, rendering, and performance hindered progress.

### Performance Considerations:
- Slow loading times and suboptimal rendering affected the overall user experience.
- The project needed a more robust solution.

## A New Beginning
- In response to these challenges, a new version of EMWebKit emerged—one powered by the Chromium project. This revamped approach aimed to address limitations and provide a better solution for cross-language GUI development.
